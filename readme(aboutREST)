The client side has to requests which are inside two different functions, formData() and findData().

formData() has a POST method which inputs data with JSON.stringify into the server. It uses a array variable called data which takes the values from form.html's form. 

findData() is an async function that fetches data from the server with user inputted string. It returns the response as response.json and this is inputted into a variable called data
in the client side. This is get method. 

There is also a unused createDB() function, that was supposed to create a new database from the client, but I thought that it was kind of useless and a little too complicated. This is a get method.
